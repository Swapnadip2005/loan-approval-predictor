# LoanIQ: AI-Powered Loan Approval Model

**`LoanIQ`** is a **`Machine Learning Project`** that predicts loan approval decisions using a **`Random Forest Classifier`**. The model analyzes applicant financial data such as `Annual Income`, `Credit Score`, `Requested Loan Amount`, `Monthly Expense`, and moreâ€”to automate and streamline the loan approval process. 
This repository provides code for:
- **Data Gathering**
- **EDA - Read and explore the data** 
- **Feature creation**
- **Train Test split the data**
- **Fit and evaluate model**
- **Feature importance**
making it easy to reproduce results or integrate into larger systems.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Efficient Feature Handling**: Preprocesses and encodes both categorical and numerical applicant data for optimal model performance.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: End-to-end workflow from raw data to trained model and evaluation metrics.
- **Model Insights**: Offers feature importance analysis for explainability and decision transparency.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- **Git/GitHub** (version control)
- **VSCode** (recommended IDE)
